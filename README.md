# Niépce

An assembly of microservices to manage tagged images.

Dedicated to [the earliest pioneer of photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nic%C3%A9phore_Ni%C3%A9pce).

As my first standalone development in Java, it is –and will be– an ever evolving ecosystem of services. 

And it will probably not happen...
